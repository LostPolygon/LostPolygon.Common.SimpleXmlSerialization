# LostPolygon.Common.SimpleXmlSerialization

A simple framework designed to simplify de/-serializing simple classes. In general, serializers work by allowing you to define which data to serialize and how using attributes, and for complex cases, writing custom serializers is inconvenient and prone to code duplication. This frameworks solves this issue by allowing user to write a single piece of code for both serialization and deserialization.
